## About the Template

This is a reusable LaTeX Template for journals in the Humanities. It was originally developed for [Variants](https://journals.openedition.org/variants/) (the journal of the [European Society for Textual Scholarship](https://textualscholarship.eu/)) by [Wout Dillen](https://github.com/WoutDLN).

Although the template and its design choices are documented in the code itself, a [documentation website](https://woutdln.github.com/varianTeX) with more user-friendly instructions on how to use it is currently under construction.

## About the Author

This template was developed by [Wout Dillen](https://github.com/WoutDLN), a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of Antwerp](https://uantwerpen.be) as part of his position as the university's CLARIAH-VL coordinator. He is also the General Editor of the Variants journal from Issue 15 onwards.
